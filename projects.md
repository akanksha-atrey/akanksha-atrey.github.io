> **Exploratory Not Explanatory: Counterfactual Analysis of Saliency Maps for Deep RL**

Saliency maps are frequently used to support explanations of the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. However, a review of how saliency maps are used in practice indicates that the derived explanations are often unfalsifiable and can be highly subjective. We introduce an empirical approach grounded in counterfactual reasoning to test the hypotheses generated from saliency maps and assess the degree to which they correspond to the semantics of RL environments. We use Atari games, a common benchmark for deep RL, to evaluate three types of saliency maps. Our results show the extent to which existing claims about Atari games can be evaluated and suggest that saliency maps are best viewed as an exploratory tool rather than an explanatory tool.

> **Identifying When Effect Restoration Will Improve Estimates of Causal Effect**

Several methods have been developed that combine multiple models learned on different data sets and then use that combination to reach conclusions that would not have been possible with any one of the models alone. We examine one such method—effect restoration—which was originally developed to mitigate the effects of poorly measured confounding variables in a causal model. We show how effect restoration can be used to combine results from different machine learning models and how the combined model can be used to estimate causal effects that are not identifiable from either of the original studies alone. We characterize the performance of effect restoration by using both theoretical analysis and simulation studies. Specifically, we show how conditional independence tests and common assumptions can help distinguish when effect restoration should and should not be applied, and we use empirical analysis to show the limited range of conditions under which effect restoration should be applied in practical situations.

> **Measuring and Characterizing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning**

Deep reinforcement-learning methods have achieved remarkable performance on challenging control tasks. Observations of the resulting behavior give the impression that the agent has constructed a generalized representation that supports insightful action decisions. We re-examine what is meant by generalization in RL, and propose several definitions based on an agent's performance in on-policy, off-policy, and unreachable states. We propose a set of practical methods for evaluating agents with these definitions of generalization. We demonstrate these techniques on a common benchmark task for deep RL, and we show that the learned networks make poor decisions for states that differ only slightly from on-policy states, even though those states are not selected adversarially. Taken together, these results call into question the extent to which deep Q-networks learn generalized representations, and suggest that more experimentation and analysis is necessary before claims of representation learning can be supported.

> **Faces in Places: Real-time Diversity Analytics Using Social Media**

The objective of this work is to determine whether a social media-based computational framework can be employed/deployed to obtain diversity, and segregation scores at very fine (i.e. individual relationships) resolution. Specifically, we focus on Instagram photos of multiple people interacting, and employ automatic methods for race, age, and gender estimation to quantify mixing in such photos. Results obtained motivate the use of social media photos to complement census data to develop cheaper, faster, mechanisms for studying diversity and applying them in social, economic, political, and urban planning contexts. Applications of this have been extended to understanding whether a similar framework can be employed to obtain smile and diversity scores at very fine, individual relationship resolution, and study their associations via Twitter and Instagram.

> **E-petition Information Diffusion in Online Social Networks** 

E-petitioning, a genre of technology-based collective action tools, makes it possible for members of the public to address government decision makers directly with their requests for action. In this work, we use time series analysis to explore the effects of Twitter and other forms of online media on the accumulation of signatures in e-petitioning. We explore the case of "Bring Back Our Girls," a Change.org petition initiated in spring 2014 following the abduction of 276 female students from a school in Chibok, Nigeria. The petition targeted government leaders around the world. We found evidence that tweeting and certain forms of online media are related to the likelihood of individuals signing an e-petition, providing evidence of a hybrid media system in which diverse forms of online media behave with diverse logics and impacts in their effects on e-petitions.

> **Reeb Graph Based Validation of Statistical Predictive Models for Spread of AIDS**

This work presents a method to quantify the differences in data using a newly defined distance metric between graphs that is used to study, analyze and validate a statistical predictive model. The proposed method constructs smoothed Reeb graphs of a given graph, which is then used to compare different outcomes of the statistical model. The method to was intended to study the given AIDS data by analyzing the output of the models in order to identify how relationships among people in a community affects their susceptibility to AIDS. In order to do this, we have applied ideas from computational topology techniques to be able to do statistics on graphs.
