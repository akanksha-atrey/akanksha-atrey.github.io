> **Reeb Graph Based Validation of Statistical Predictive Models for Spread of AIDS**
(Nov 2014 – Dec 2015)

This work presents a method to quantify the differences in data using a newly defined distance metric between graphs that is used to study, analyze and validate a statistical predictive model. The proposed method constructs smoothed Reeb graphs of a given graph, which is then used to compare different outcomes of the statistical model. The method to was intended to study the given AIDS data by analyzing the output of the models in order to identify how relationships among people in a community affects their susceptibility to AIDS. In order to do this, we have applied ideas from computational topology techniques to be able to do statistics on graphs.

> **Twitter Popularity Diffusion of Presidential Candidates through Detection of Twitter Bots**
(Aug 2016 – Jan 2017)

The objective of this work was to detect popularity diffusion patterns on Twitter in the 2016 US Presidential Election and consider the implications and effects of Twitter bots.

> **E-petition Information Diffusion in Online Social Networks** 
(Jan 2016 – Feb 2017)

We are exploring twitter data for the Bring Back Our Girls project. Our main purpose is to find statistical patterns and mine the data. All work is coded in Python and requires the use of NetworkX.

> **Faces in Places: Real-time Diversity Analytics Using Social Media**
(May 2016 – Present)

The objective is to determine whether a social media-based computational framework can be employed/deployed to obtain diversity, and segregation scores at very fine (individual relationships) resolution.
