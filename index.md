## About Me

I am a second year MS/PhD student at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). As part of the [Knowledge Discovery Laboratory](https://kdl-umass.github.io/), I work with Prof. [David Jensen](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jensen/). My current research interests lie in building and using causal models to explain deep networks. I am also interested in interdisciplinary applications of causal modeling, particularly security and computational social science.

My prior work (produced in my undergrad) have been oriented towards using data mining and machine learning techniques to understand real world issues in the fields of computational social science, information science, applied statistics and mathematics.

Prior to joining UMass, I was a software engineer at IBM where I worked on the IBM z/OS Mainframe. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from the State University of New York at Albany.
