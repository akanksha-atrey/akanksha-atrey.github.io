## About Me

I am a fourth year MS/Ph.D. student. My current research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, edge computing, and privacy with a focus on applications in IoT and blockchain. Particularly, I am interested in characterizing, evaluating and building privacy-preserving distributed systems and machine learning models. 

My prior work in graduate school has been oriented towards employing causal modeling techniques to understand, evaluate and develop deep reinforcement learning agents.

Prior to joining UMass, I was a software engineer at IBM where I worked on the z/OS Mainframe. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from the [University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/).
