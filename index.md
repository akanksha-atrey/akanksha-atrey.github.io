## About Me

I am a third year MS/PhD student at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I work with Prof. [Prashant Shenoy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~shenoy/) in the [Laboratory for Advanced Software Systems](http://lass.cs.umass.edu/). My current research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and systems. I am interested in two subtasks at this intersection: (1) understanding and evaluating the privacy implications of advanced ML models, and (2) understanding and evaluating the privacy implications of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the goal of developing countermeasures. 

My prior work in graduate school has been oriented towards employing causal modeling techniques to understand, evaluate and develop ML models.

Prior to joining UMass, I was a software engineer at IBM where I worked on the IBM z/OS Mainframe. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from the State University of New York at Albany.
