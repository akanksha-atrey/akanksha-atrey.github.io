## About Me

My current research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and edge computing with a focus on applications in IoT and mobile computing. My work has spanned over building systems for machine learning that enable explainability and generalizability, building trustworthy and privacy-preserving ML systems, and designing machine learning solutions for ubiquitous computing. 

Particularly, my PhD thesis focused on characterizing, evaluating and building trustworthy and privacy-preserving machine learning systems on resource-constrained edge environments.

Prior to joining UMass, I was a software engineer at IBM where I worked on the z/OS Mainframe. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from the [University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/).

Starting October, I will be joining [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref) as a Research Scientist in the Autonomous Systems Research Department.
